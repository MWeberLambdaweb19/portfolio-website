Music Makes My Voice Come Out
--------------------------------

As I close my eyes to choir music
Its vocals and tempo increasing
Volume.

I can feel something inside me -
Something that is me but not me
A voice.

They want to take over me,
My body, my mind, my soul,
With sound.

I cannot stop the music.
